## 沒戰escription

Chess is one of the most stimulating games for the mind and appreciated world over for the sharpness of brain required by players and ease of learning the moves. We are planning to build an automatic chessboard. This can be used by players with disabilities. Or by people who do not have a partner to play with or a teacher to teach them in real life. Or by people separated by geography but reminisce the time they used to play chess. Or by lazy people. Or as an awesome thing to display to their guests. This is Harry Potter come true. You can play any move as you would play a real game of chess and the chess board will automatically play a move based on the difficulty that you can preset.


## 洟傍echnologies and approach
We are using the following technologies which include a variety of disciplines such as electronics, mechanics and software. 
- An electromagnet guided by motors via pulleys to move pieces. 
- A single board computer to detect the moves played by you and also play the next move. It will control all movements of hardware motors. Electronics also include magnetic switches which will act as a sensor to detect where the moves have been made by user. 
- An interactive web app so that you can play from miles away. We have 3D printed various parts that attach the aluminium rails. 
- A multiplexer to sense which of the 64 spaces on the board is active. Each piece is fitted with a magnet of its own which attaches to the electromagnet and slides over the board. Move validation will happen here.
- The code is written in C++ and Arduino C. The webapp is made using React and we have used api calls to integrate it with the microcontroller.

[Video Demonstration (WIP)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n4CHXYQZQM9E5KBrQ1_CQI-dBuEgY22M/view)


## 洟傍ech-Stack


#### Languages
- Arduino C
- C++



#### Software
- Arduino IDE


## 沐ｮFuture Scope



In the future, we are also planning to integrate features with which you can play using voice commands and an AI tutor that will teach you various chess theories step by step. There will also be an option to reset all the pieces to their original position, play the daily puzzle and so on and so forth. You can also set a timer on the board itself to play timed and competitive games. There will also be an option to analyze your games step by step using a speaker. 



## 泝Project Setup

1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raghavkorde/autochess.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repo and open Automatic_Chessboard_V3.ino file in Arduino IDE
